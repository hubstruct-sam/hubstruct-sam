- Hi! I’m Samuele aka @hubstruct (IG/Twitter), a generative artist based in Italy
- I’m interested in everything related to computers and coding, leaning towards graphics, especially stuff related to morphogenesis and biological simulations
- Here you can find an example of my work, from my physarum polycephalum implementation: instagram.com/p/CUQAl9NtT5k 
- Everyday I try to become a better coder and artist, I love to produce interesting visuals while trying to keep performant my code
- I currently work as a crypto artist, you can find my works across many platforms, such as HEN and Foundation, @hubstruct as always
- If you're interested in my work you can find all the links to my socials and contacts in my GitHub bio
